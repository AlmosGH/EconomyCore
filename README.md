# The New Economy
The New Economy, TNE, is the ultimate economy plugin for your Minecraft server, no matter what platform you're on. While
TNE is pushed as being "feature-packed," it's not feature packed in the normal sense of jamming a bunch of useless features
into the core plugin, but rather using modules.
