# Beta 1.2 (0.1.2.0)

## Summary

With TNE Beta 1.2, TNE is going back to its roots. This means providing you, the server owner, with the economy
experience that you deserve, and the features and ease-of-use that you expect. The TNE experience has been slacking, and
for that I apologize, but it's time to kick TNE back into shape and get your economy solution back to Platinum Standard. 
With this release I have implemented the majority of the ease-of-use features that you, the owners and users, have
requested. Start experiencing the ultimate economy experience!

## Features

With Beta 1.2 comes some feature additions.

- Added bungeecord support
- Menus Galore!
  - Added a currency editor menu
  - Added a MyBAL menu
    - Users may do everything from convert their currency, to make notes, to pay other players from this menu!
  - Added a MySERVER menu, to help admins modify TNE settings
- Currency System changes
  - Added a new "Mixed" currency type.
    - This allows your users to have a virtual currency, but also be able to withdraw it into items
  - We now support offline payment using ender chests for item currencies!
  - Currencies are no longer case-sensitive
  - Completely revamped the currency conversion system.

## Internal

In Beta 1.2 a lot of the TNE internals have been rewritten from the ground up. This will help facilitate future updates
and help with making TNE even more efficient.

Specific Internal Changes:
- Made TNE not rely on bukkit/spigot, this now allows me to work on sponge support!
- Rewrote database code entirely.
- Rewrote menu system entirely.
- Rewrote caching system entirely.
- Rewrote Account system entirely.
- Rewrote transaction system entirely.
- Rewrote transaction history system entirely.
- Rewrote currency system entirely.
- Rewrote currency loading system entirely.
- Command System has been switched to ACF
- Made all data-storable objects able to be serialized into JSON
  - This will assist with the future web account dashboard and RESTAPI

## Removed

Some TNE features have been removed in this release in order to help keep TNE innovating and evolving.

- Removed commands.yml
- Removed basic currency system found in config.yml
  - This tended to confuse users having two different systems and ultimately was not how the systems were anticipated
  to be
- Removed the UUID configuration from config.yml. Use online mode or a proxy.
